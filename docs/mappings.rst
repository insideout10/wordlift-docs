Mappings
========

Mappings are designed to help us organize and structure content while improving the SEO on our website. 

**The markup in schema.org adds meaning to your content** for search engines but the real benefits come when you **use structured data as the basis for your content model.**

We call it the **entity-based content model** and you can learn more about by watching the following webinars:

* `Content Modeling for Search Optimization with Cruce Saunders <https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/content-modeling/>`_
* `Get Started with Structured Content and Schema.org <https://wordlift.io/academy-entries/structure-your-content/>`_

Or by `booking a call with our SEO experts. <https://wordlift.io/book-a-demo>`_.

WordLift mappings have been developed as an integration for the `Advanced Custom Fields <https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/>`_ plugin and allows you to either: 
 
* re-use fields that you might have already configured with ACF on your CMS or,
* create new fields based on the schema.org taxonomy

WordLift loads automatically the latest version of schema.org and allows you to personalize your content model easily while taking care of the injection of the json-ld on your pages.
