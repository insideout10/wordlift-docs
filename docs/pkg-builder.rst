At the moment, only one language per import is supported, therefore if your feed contains multiple languages, use the *Path* to filter the language, e.g. **/en** . Then you can create another configuration for another language.

3. Create your Product Knowledge Graph
-----------------

Link the website and import the data from the Merchant Feed to the website.

Click *Finish*. Once you have completed these 3 steps, you will see that the **products** have been imported into the backend of your e-commerce website and **already enriched with structured data**.

From the WordLift dashboard, you can open the backend of your website and see the products imported and you can synchronize the data (it takes about 1 hour).
